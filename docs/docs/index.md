# Causal Inferance documentation!

## Description

Many research papers that analyze factors that contribute to financial well-being are often descriptive and do not make casual inference (Sajid, Mushtaq, Murtaza, Yahiaoui, & Pereira, 2024). They often employ OLS regression to obtain coefficient estimates that describe the impact a unit increase in a particular feature (e.g., financial literary, financial confidence) causes on financial-wellbeing. In my analysis, I intend to move past descriptive analysis by utilizing a casual machine learning framework known as double machine learning which treats observational data as if it were a randomized control trial. By assigning observations to treatment groups within covariate profiles, I will attempt to understand the average treatment affect that financial literacy has on the financial well-being.
